# SiCK-68 QMK Keyboard layout

This repo contains the keyboard layout that I use on my personal handwired SiCK-68 3D printed keyboard. I use a different wiring system compared to the wiring in the QMK handwired repo, which is why I made this version.

This firmware was built using https://kbfirmware.com/.
